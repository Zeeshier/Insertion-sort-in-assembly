Insertion Sort in Assembly Language
This is a simple implementation of the insertion sort algorithm in assembly language for the x86 architecture.

Description
This program sorts a hardcoded array of numbers in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm. The array is defined in the data segment as ar db -1,5,6,2,9,3. The program then prints the sorted array to the console.

Code Organization
The code is organized into the following sections:

Data
Defines the program's data, including the array to be sorted and other variables.

Code
Contains the program's logic, including the insertion sort algorithm and the output loop.

How to Run
To run this program, you will need an assembler (such as MASM or TASM) and a DOS emulator (such as DOSBox). Assemble the program using the assembler, then run the resulting executable file in the DOS emulator.
